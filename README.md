## 📄 Pages

| Route | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/` | Login |
| `/register` | User registration |
| `/user` | Main dashboard |
| `/tasks` | Task management |
| `/profile` | User profile and settings |

## 🔐 Authentication

- The backend returns a JWT after login or registration.
- The token is currently stored in `localStorage`.
- Axios automatically attaches the token to requests via interceptors.
- If the token is missing or invalid, the user is redirected to the login page.
